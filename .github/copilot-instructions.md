## How to Use These Instructions

1. **Start with Thinking**: Read how-to-think.md to understand the thinking framework
2. **Understand the Domain**: Review the project context to understand what we're building
3. **Apply Thoughtfully**: Use these as thinking tools, not rigid rules
4. **Adhere to SOLID principles**:
   - **Single Responsibility**: Each module should have one responsibility.
   - **Open/Closed**: Modules should be open for extension but closed for modification.
   - **Liskov Substitution**: Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types.
   - **Interface Segregation**: Prefer small, specific interfaces over large, general-purpose ones.
   - **Dependency Inversion**: Depend on abstractions, not concretions.
5. **Fix from the root**: Address issues at their source, not just the symptoms.
6. **Iterate and Refine**: Continuously improve the instructions based on feedback and results.
